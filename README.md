# Flexible-Manipulator
Modelling of a flexible manipulator using Differential Flatness

To see calculations, refer to [nlinkctrb.m](https://github.com/DhruvKoolRajamani/Flexible-Manipulator/blob/master/nlinkctrb.m)

To see final controllability and linearized matrices, refer to [linearized.m](https://github.com/DhruvKoolRajamani/Flexible-Manipulator/blob/master/Linearized.m)

To see animation, open [sim_nlink.m](https://github.com/DhruvKoolRajamani/Flexible-Manipulator/blob/master/sim_nlink.m) and run the file.

    Vary the initial values for y0 = [theta1 theta2 theta3 w1 w2 w3]
    Vary timespan
    Vary input forces
